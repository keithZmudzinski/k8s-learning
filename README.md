# k8s-learning

## Goal
Familiarize myself with kubernetes.<br>
To do so, I will create an app. This app will provide me a framework within which I can use as many kubernetes resources as possible.

## App
Given a target OS name and command, return the standard out of running the command on the target OS.

## Development
Development will all be done locally, because I am a cheapskate and don't want to pay for cloud services.<br>
Development steps tbd.

## Tech used
+ minikube using docker engine
+ helm
+ docker
+ django
+ prometheus
+ fluentbit
+ grafana
+ linkerd
+ Possibly Dex,for SSO to the cluster
+ Possibly Kiosk, for self-service namespaces
+ Some combination of DevSpace, Skaffold, Tilt, and Telepresence
  + these provide development enhancements for working directly with the cluster from your machine.
